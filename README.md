  Lavish Salon is a beauty parlor based out of Oldtown, Idaho. It was founded by Amanda Johnson in early 2016.
  This website is designed with the client in mind; it is both desktop & mobile friendly.

  If the appointment is approved, Amanda will then add the client's request to her editable admin-side calendar. The information on Amanda's admin calendar is reflected on the client-side, sans client information, to prevent clients from booking appointment times that are already taken.
